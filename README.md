# BoardMapper

## Overview
BoardMapper is an open-source tool designed to automatically generate a component placement map for PCBs. It labels component references (U1, R1, C1, etc.) directly on the board image, simplifying assembly and troubleshooting.

## Purpose
- **Automation**: Eliminates the need for manual placement annotation on PCB layouts.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time for engineers and makers working on PCB assembly.
- **Clarity**: Provides a clear visual reference for debugging and manufacturing.
